# State_Pattern_ParticleSystem


https://aiarcost.github.io/State_Pattern_ParticleSystem/


This is a project going over the state pattern. This was used through the state pattern via code on top of the animator states in Unity. 

Note: The E and Q buttons must be held down to see the state change.
